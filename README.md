This is the week #2 weekend challenge for Makers Academy. The challenge is more advanced than the Airport Challenge, requiring use of a third party API to send texts, and more thorough application of SOLID principles.

## User Stories

We have the following user stories to implement in this project:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

## My Approach

I tackled this challenge by creating 4 types of classes: Takeaway, Menu, Basket, and Text. I created 2 different menus, allowing the user to load the menu that they prefer when ordering dishes. The way to use the app is as follows:
* The preferred menu, the basket, and the text classes are loaded into the Takeaway class.
* The user can `list_dishes` to see the menu.
* Items can be added to the basket with `add_dish`, specifying the name of the item and the quantity. If the name given isn't on the menu, the user will see an error message.
* Using `view_basket` will show the current items in their basket, their quantities, and the total cost of that quantity.
* The user can then `place_order`, specifying the total cost of their basket. If the incorrect total is given, the user will see an error message and will have to enter the correct total.
* When the order is successfully placed, a confirmation text will be sent to the user's phone, thanking them for the order and giving them an ETA for delivery (+ 1 hour from the current time).

Because of the way I have structured my code, any type of menu, basket, or text class can be loaded into the takeaway, making the program much more flexible.

Twilio is used to send the texts. I used Webmock to test my texting system effectively without sending texts in the process.

## Example

Here is an example of my code being used:

```
$ irb
2.5.0 :001 > require 'twilio-ruby'
 => true
2.5.0 :002 > Dir["#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/lib/**/*.rb"].each { |f| require(f) }
 => ["./lib/chinese_menu.rb", "./lib/text.rb", "./lib/basket.rb", "./lib/pizzeria_menu.rb", "./lib/takeaway.rb"]

 # After loading in the required files, the user creates a new Takeaway object, using the chosen menu, basket, and text classes
2.5.0 :003 > takeaway = Takeaway.new(PizzeriaMenu, Basket, Text)
 => #<Takeaway:0x00007fd39225e320 @menu=#<PizzeriaMenu:0x00007fd39225e2d0 @dishes=[{"Margherita"=>7.5}, {"Bufala"=>8}, {"Anchovy"=>8}, {"Pepperoni"=>8.5}, {"Calabria"=>8.5}, {"Quattro Formaggio"=>10}, {"Truffle"=>12.5}, {"Gold Pizza"=>1200}], @title="* * * PAPA'S * PIZZERIA * * *\n">, @basket_class=Basket, @basket=nil, @text=Text>

 # The list_dishes method can be used to view the menu (it will appear unformatted until used outside of irb)
2.5.0 :004 > takeaway.list_dishes
 => "* * * PAPA'S * PIZZERIA * * *\n1) Margherita: £7.50\n2) Bufala: £8.00\n3) Anchovy: £8.00\n4) Pepperoni: £8.50\n5) Calabria: £8.50\n6) Quattro Formaggio: £10.00\n7) Truffle: £12.50\n8) Gold Pizza: £1200.00\n"

 # Dishes are added with their quantities, and an incorrect dish returns an error
2.5.0 :005 > takeaway.add_dish("Margherita", 2)
 => "Margherita x 2 added to the basket."
2.5.0 :006 > takeaway.add_dish("Pepperoni", 1)
 => "Pepperoni x 1 added to the basket."
2.5.0 :007 > takeaway.add_dish("Snail Pizza", 5)

        5: from /Users/Joel/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'

RuntimeError (Cannot find the specified dish!)
2.5.0 :008 > takeaway.add_dish("Gold Pizza", 1)
 => "Gold Pizza x 1 added to the basket."

 # The basket can be viewed at any time
2.5.0 :009 > takeaway.view_basket
 => [{:name=>"Margherita", :quantity=>2, :cost=>15.0}, {:name=>"Pepperoni", :quantity=>1, :cost=>8.5}, {:name=>"Gold Pizza", :quantity=>1, :cost=>1200.0}]

 # The order is placed, and a confirmation text is sent. An incorrect total given returns an error
2.5.0 :010 > takeaway.place_order(15 + 8.5 + 1300)
Traceback (most recent call last):
        3: from /Users/Joel/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
        2: from (irb):10
        1: from /Users/Joel/Makers/week2/takeaway-challenge/lib/takeaway.rb:19:in `place_order'
RuntimeError (Incorrect total given!)
2.5.0 :011 > takeaway.place_order(15 + 8.5 + 1200)
 => "Order placed! Look out for a confirmation text."
2.5.0 :012 > exit
```

The program can be run using `irb`. Tests are run using `rspec`.
